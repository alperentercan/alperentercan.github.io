Our work on solving multi-objective control tasks with lexicographic preferences and {temporal logic-based reward specifications} required me to combine my knowledge and expertise in optimization, RL, and formal methods. In this work, I've developed a taxonomy of control tasks with thresholded lexicographic objectives and used it to show how the current RL approaches fail in certain settings. Then, I discussed several fixes to current methods to improve their performance. Finally, I proposed and tested a novel policy gradient algorithm based on hypercone projections of the policy gradients.
