The state-of-the-art neural program synthesis methods fail for relatively complex problems(finding the mid-point of a line) which require multiple level nesting. Therefore, we developed a task decomposition framework which can automatically break any task into simpler subtasks that progressively lead to the original task. These subtasks can be used to create a curriculum for faster learning.

We then tested the effectiveness of our approach for an RL agent in solving neural program synthesis problems. Moreover, we conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our task decomposition for human learners who try to solve complex Karel tasks.
