Many real-world problems require flexible, scalable,
and fine-grained access control policies. Next Generation Access
Control(NGAC) framework inherits these traits from Attribute
Based Access Control(ABAC) and provides an intuitive graphbased
approach. In this work, we augment NGAC framework with
multi-level rule hierarchy and stateful policies. Then, we show how
an NGAC policy can be analyzed together with an environment
model using Alloy. This allows defining complex dynamic systems
and keeping policies still tractable for automated analysis. We
present our approach on emergency fire response problem.
