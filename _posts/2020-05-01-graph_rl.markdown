In this project, the use of reinforcement learning for heuristics in graph algorithms is
investigated. This line of research can be seen as an extension of general trend in computer
science research to replace rule-based, hand-crafted heuristics with data-driven methods. The
project focus was identifying possible future research directions rather than a comprehensive
survey of the field.

Although the project was done primarily for educational purposes, it contributes to
the field with a more mathematically rigorous and RL-oriented analysis. Mainly, we formulate the underlying MDP that papers implicitly assume. This is important for fruitful and mathematically-sound discussions and research for further use of RL in combinatorial
optimization problems over graphs. Also, the report provides a unified analysis of two papers
using the formulated framework; which proves to be useful for juxtaposition of two papers.
